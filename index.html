        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <p>San Vicente National High School (formerly known as San Pablo City National High School-San Vicente Annex) was first an 
          extension of San Pablo City National High School located in the city proper. Barangay High Schools came into picture to 
          remedy the growing number of high school students in the locality of San Pablo and to address the constitutional right of 
          every child for a formal quality education.<br>
    
          <br>In the School Year 2002, four hardworking and dedicated faculty members namely: Mrs. Emelia P. Crescini, Mr. Christopher
          A. Platero, Ms. Joyce D. Santino and Mrs. Adora 1.Paulino who also acted as Teacher Leader, ploneered the said school. They 
          accepted the remarkable first batch of enrollees which was composed of 238 students, which compose of 137 All of them were
          residents of Barangay San Vicente, and other neighboring barangays such as San Antonio 1 and 2, Sta, Ana, Sta. Cruz, San 
          Ignacio and San Joaquin. Classes were held at San Vicente Elementary School Covered Court wherein they built four rooms made
          of plywood. The construction of a 2-storey building housing 4 classrooms and a 3-classroom building in the almost one hectare 
          government lot was started in July, 2003 and ended on October of the same year.<br><br>
    
          San Vicente National High School had its first batch of graduates in March, 2006. There were 70 male and 62 female hopeful
          students who went up on stage to receive their diplomas.<br><br>
    
          Today, SVNHS has a well-developed school system. It has now thirteen classrooms and a computer laboratory with ten computer 
          units enabling the students to achieve a much higher educational achievement. Nineteen competent and diligent mentors comprise 
          the faculty force Initiating the present enrolment of seven hundred students to become a responsible members of their community.<br><br>
    
          Truly, SVNHS is soaring high in greater heights and will be an arm to achieve formal and quality education to the Filipino youth.</p>
